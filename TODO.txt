### TODO

- Implement settings for key index settings (morphology, min word length, etc.)
- Faceted search (?)
- Recommended/related content (?)

### HARD TASKS

- Currently MVAs are named by table.field which limits the ability to reference
  the same table.field multiple times but with different queries (e.g. a facet
  per taxonomy vocabulary). Come up with an MVA naming convention that allows
  this possibility.
- Getting node_access attributes into the index

### Known issues

- I have noticed trouble with filtering on ordinals under strange situations
  (specifically, node_type could not be filtered on). After re-ordering the
  fields so that node_type occurred last or nearly last, things began working.
